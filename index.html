        <h2>Senior in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
        
         <p>I'm a senior student at Bob Jones University. My journey in academia has been centered around the dynamic field of business, where I've been cultivating skills and knowledge that I am eager to apply in meaningful ways. Beyond the classroom, my true passion lies in gospel sharing and youth ministry. I find immense joy in connecting with others, fostering a sense of community, and spreading the gospel. I aspire to merge my enthusiasm for business with my commitment to ministry. I am driven by the belief that effective business practices can amplify the reach and impact of organizations devoted to making a difference in the lives of others.</p>
